## Requirement

- Compiling the projet (please refear to the README.md)

## Lanch the game

- ### **Start the binary**

    To start the binary, navigate to the `build/` directory and run `./r-type_client`.

    You will be presented with two different options:

- ### **Host a game**

    The first option is to click the `Héberger` button to host a game locally on your computer.

    After clicking `Héberger`, you will be prompted to choose a **nickname** (in a text input field), select the game mode (**Endless, 1v1, History**), choose a **spaceship**, and pick the **bullet type**.

    Once you have selected your parameters, you can join the lobby by clicking Créer la partie.

    #### *You must fill in all these fields in order to start the game.*

    #### *If you're playing solo, simply play as the host. You will be automatically connected to your local server.*

- ### **Or join an existing game**

    If your friend has already hosted a game, you can join them using the `Rejoindre` button.

    After clicking the button, you will need to enter the host's IP address. Make sure to enter the host's IPV4 address and ensure that both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

    Once you've entered the **IP**, you'll need to choose a **nickname**, a **spaceship**, and a **bullet type**.

    Finally, click the Rejoindre button to join the lobby.

    #### *You must fill in all these fields in order to start the game.*

    #### *To find the host's IP address, the host must run the `ifconfig` command in a terminal.*

- ### **Lobby Management**

    The lobby scene is simply a waiting room.

    You must wait for your friend, and when all players are connected, click the `Start` button to begin the game.

    #### *For the 1v1 game mode, make sure to start the game with a maximum of 2 players to avoid potential bugs.*

- ### **Settings**

    You can view the key bindings in the settings.
